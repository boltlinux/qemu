Description: QEMU user mode emulation binaries (static version)
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4,
 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides the user mode emulation binaries, built
 statically. In this mode QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled for
 one CPU on another CPU.
 .
 qemu-user-static package will register binary formats which the provided
 emulators can handle, so that it will be possible to run foreign binaries
 directly.
